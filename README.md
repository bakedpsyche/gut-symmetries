# Cultural Interfaces
---
The exercise was part of the New Media course taught by Prof.Mriganka Madhukaillya.

The motive of the exercise was to explore the various formats and to apply principles of new media and to reproduce the same fragment of information in 3 different forms: Text, Cinema and HCI.

This interactive experience was the part where HCI was to be used to communicate the information, in this case a poem from 'Gut Symmetries' novel by Jeanette Winterson.

The mesh such as the walls, floor and the text plates, were made using blender and a bare bone code was generated using A-Frame addon, most of the code generated by the addon was disposed as a lot of the functionalities were not required, the redundant codes were also lagging the responsiveness.

A nav mesh was generated and the user movement has been constrained to the path, this keeps the camera from clipping into the walls.
